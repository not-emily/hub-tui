# Daily Report - hub-tui - 2026-01-07

## Summary
Today focused on QoL improvements to the TUI: implemented Claude Code-style autocomplete that auto-shows when typing `/`, `@`, or `#`, and added a Shift+C workflow cancel feature with a 30-second hint window. Also discovered a hub-core bug where the dismiss endpoint returns "run not found" for valid runs.

## Progress Today
- Implemented auto-show autocomplete when typing `/`, `@`, `#` prefixes
- Changed Enter behavior: executes `/commands` and `#workflows` directly, completes `@assistants`
- Added Shift+C to cancel the most recently started workflow
- Implemented 30-second cancel hint that clears on timeout or workflow completion
- Single active hint model - new workflow clears previous hint
- Added `AutocompletePrefix()`, `MessageCount()`, `UpdateMessageContent()` methods to chat model
- Added `WorkflowHintExpiredMsg` message type
- Added workflow hint tracking state to app Model

## Decisions Made
None formally documented today.

## Blockers & Issues
- **hub-core bug**: Dismiss endpoint (`POST /runs/{id}/dismiss`) returns "run not found" for valid runs that are visible in the /tasks list. User will investigate hub-core side.

## Next Steps
- Commit the autocomplete/workflow UX changes
- Decide on next enhancement (oauth config type, workflow management, etc.)
- Fix hub-core dismiss endpoint bug

## Context for Next Session
- Uncommitted changes in `internal/app/app.go`, `internal/app/messages.go`, `internal/ui/chat/chat.go`
- v4-config-types plan is complete - may want to archive it
- The "run not found" error on workflow cancel is expected for fast workflows (race condition) - could soften that message later
