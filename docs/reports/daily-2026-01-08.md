# Daily Report - hub-tui - 2026-01-08

## Summary
Focused on quality-of-life improvements for the tasks modal. Added manual refresh capability and simplified workflow output display to use the new `result.output` field from hub-core instead of iterating through step-by-step results.

## Progress Today
- Added `[r]` refresh hotkey to tasks modal (list view, history view, detail view)
- Added `Output` field to `RunResult` struct in client and app packages
- Simplified `formatRunOutput()` to return `result.Output` directly instead of parsing step outputs
- Removed unused `encoding/json` import from tasks modal
- Discussed future enhancement: server-side `output_format` field for rendering hints (markdown/json)

## Decisions Made
None formally logged. Discussion: decided to display workflow output as-is for now, with server potentially providing `output_format` hints in the future rather than client-side detection.

## Blockers & Issues
None

## Next Steps
- Decide on next enhancement or QoL improvement
- Potential future work: output format hints from server, oauth/email_pass config types, workflow enable/disable/delete

## Context for Next Session
- Workflow outputs can be markdown or JSON - currently displayed as-is
- If rendering becomes an issue, hub-core could add `output_format` field to guide TUI rendering
- The `Steps` field is preserved in `RunResult` for backwards compatibility but not used for display
